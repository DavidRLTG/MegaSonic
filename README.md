# The music player that tries to be different.
MegaSonic is a Music Player for Linux (and possibly Windows), although it is currently in concept stage, with it having no code at the moment, just concept images.

This project may come to fruition in the future, if I can gather some contributors.

At this time, This repository is just a placeholder.
